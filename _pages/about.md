👋 Hi, I’m Simone, an AI Research Engineer working at the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**. My work focuses on **representation learning**, **vision-language alignment**, and **weakly, semi-, and self-supervised learning** for semantic and instance-level visual understanding.

📚 My research interests lie in **Multimodal Learning**, **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, and **Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAMs)**. I am particularly interested in grounding language into **dense visual predictions** (segmentation, tracking, affordances) and leveraging **foundation models** for zero- and few-shot transfer in structured vision tasks. A recurring theme is **uncertainty modeling and probabilistic priors** to improve robustness, calibration, and data efficiency under limited or noisy supervision.

🚀 I am a **co-founder of** [DeepPlants](https://www.deepplants.com/), where I led research and engineering teams building **production-grade, agentic AI systems** for micro-farming management, plant phenotyping, and agri-tech automation. My experience spans the full **research-to-production pipeline**, from dataset design and large-scale multi-GPU training to model optimization and real-world deployment.

🔙 Previously, I was an **AI Research Fellow at** [ALCOR Lab](https://alcorlab.diag.uniroma1.it/) (Sapienza University of Rome), contributing to peer-reviewed research in computer vision, with a focus on **instance segmentation and tracking** and **activity recognition**.

🎓 I earned a **PhD in Computer Science Engineering** from [DIAG](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/), Sapienza University of Rome. My doctoral research focused on **reducing supervision in semantic segmentation** through Bayesian prior modeling and structured regularization. I hold an MSc in **AI & Robotics** and a BSc in **Computer Engineering**, with a background in automation and perception-action systems.

📄 My work has been presented at **NeurIPS, ECCV, and ICCV**. Selected publications and highlights are available on the [Publications page](/publications/).
