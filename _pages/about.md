I am an research engineer working at the intersection of **computer vision** and **natural language processing**, with a focus on **representation learning**, **vision-language alignment**, and **weakly, semi-, and self-supervised learning** for **semantic and instance-level visual understanding**. My work aims to design scalable learning paradigms that reduce annotation costs while maintaining strong generalization and transfer across tasks and domains.

My research interests lie in **multimodal learning**, **Vision-Language Models**, and **Vision-Language-Action models**, with an emphasis on learning **shared representations** across vision, language, and action. I am particularly interested in grounding linguistic concepts in **dense visual predictions** such as segmentation, tracking, and affordance estimation, as well as in leveraging **foundation models** for **zero-shot and few-shot transfer** in structured vision tasks. A recurring theme in my work is the integration of **uncertainty modeling and probabilistic priors** to improve robustness, calibration, and data efficiency, especially when supervision is limited or noisy. More broadly, I am interested in closing the loop between **perception, language, and decision-making** in agentic systems operating in real-world, partially observable environments.

I am a co-founder of [DeepPlants](https://www.deepplants.com/), where I have led research and engineering teams developing **production-grade, agentic AI systems** for micro-farming management, plant phenotyping, and agri-tech automation. My work spans the full research-to-production pipeline, including **dataset curation**, **large-scale multi-GPU training**, **model optimization**, and deployment in real-world settings.

Previously, I was an **AI Research Fellow** at the [ALCOR Lab](https://alcorlab.diag.uniroma1.it/) (Sapienza Università di Roma), contributing to research projects and peer-reviewed publications in computer vision, with a focus on learning under limited supervision.

I earned a **PhD in Engineering in Computer Science** from [DIAG](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/), Sapienza Università di Roma. My doctoral thesis, *“Reducing supervision in semantic segmentation through advancements in Bayesian prior modelling,”* investigated how structured priors, regularization strategies, and probabilistic learning strategies can significantly reduce annotation requirements while improving robustness in low- and weak-label regimes.

Before my PhD, I completed an **MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics** at Sapienza Università di Roma, where my master’s thesis focused on **efficient instance segmentation and multi-object tracking** in the context of the **YouTube-VIS 2021 Challenge** at **CVPR**. I hold a **BSc in Computer Engineering** from **Roma Tre University**, with a specialization in **automation engineering**, which continues to inform my interest in closing the loop between perception and action.

My work has been presented at leading venues including **NeurIPS**, **ECCV**, and **ICCV**. A curated list of publications is available on the [Publications page](/publications/), along with selected highlights.
