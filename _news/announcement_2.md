We are currently **under review** for two EU open calls to extend the impact of **CABBO**, our multimodal AI agent for micro-farming support.

First, we are applying to join the **COSMIC** challenges on consumer-facing apps. **COSMIC** is a three-year European project that demonstrates how **AI and Big Data** can optimise energy resources across industrial, urban and residential sectors in line with the **European Green Deal** goals ([project overview](https://cosmic-horizon.eu/about)). Our goal is to position CABBO as a use case connecting **agri-food production** and **energy-aware, climate-friendly choices** for end users.

In parallel, we are preparing a proposal to the **SmartEra** open calls ([open calls](https://smartera-project.eu/open-calls/)), targeting the **Tramuntana–Sóller** pilot on a **micro-farming AI platform to support farmers** ([pilot description](https://smartera-project.eu/pilot-regions/tramuntana-soller/)). Here, CABBO is positioned as a decision-support layer that can help farmers in Mediterranean contexts manage crops, resources and environmental constraints more intelligently.

Both initiatives align CABBO with broader European efforts on **digitalisation, sustainability and data-driven agriculture**, and extend our work at DeepPlants beyond core model development towards real-world deployment and policy-relevant pilots.
