Consider a different example: <strong>Apple</strong> designs its <strong>SoCs</strong> (System-on-Chip), <strong>TSMC</strong> (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) manufactures them, and <strong>ASML</strong> provides the <strong>EUV lithography</strong> equipment needed for advanced nodes.</p> <p>The same dynamic holds for <strong>Nvidia</strong> and <strong>AI GPUs</strong>. Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs require TSMC’s <strong>5 nm</strong> or smaller process technology. TSMC, in turn, relies on ASML’s EUV tools to print the <strong>dense transistor layouts</strong>.

It cannot plan, chain steps explicitly, or act autonomously:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Emergent reasoning is limited</strong>: There’s no explicit chain-of-thought or planning; constraint satisfaction occurs implicitly across tokens.</li> <li><strong>Tokenization bottlenecks exist</strong>: Discretization is lossy, which limits fidelity for complex modalities.</li> <li><strong>Dataset alignment is partial</strong>: Some modalities and datasets are only loosely coordinated, leaving room for inconsistencies in training.</li> </ul> <p>In other words, 4M‑21 is a <strong>foundation backbone</strong>, not an agent or cognitive system. It lays the groundwork, but the “thinking” part—planning, instruction-following, and compositional reasoning—is still to come.</p> <h3 id="the-road-ahead-directions-to-watch">The Road Ahead: Directions to Watch</h3> <p>The official project and research notes point to several promising avenues:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Better tokenization schemes</strong><br/> Adaptive, higher-fidelity tokenizers could reduce reconstruction loss and improve fine-grained multimodal generation.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Explicit reasoning objectives</strong><br/> Integrating constraint-based or reasoning-centered training could turn implicit consistency into explicit reasoning capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Instruction tuning over token sequences</strong><br/> Just like LLMs benefit from instruction fine-tuning, multimodal backbones could learn to follow structured multimodal instructions across domains.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Integration with agentic architectures</strong><br/> Combining unified token spaces with LLM-style planners, memory modules, or embodied agents could finally unlock reasoning and agency in multimodal systems.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In short, 4M‑21 has built the <strong>scalable, unified foundation</strong>, and the next frontier is layering <strong>reasoning, instruction-following, and agency</strong> on top.</p> <blockquote> <p>The lesson for the field is clear: multimodal AI has crossed the threshold of scalability and unification—but intelligence still has a way to go. The foundation is there; now comes the building.</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://4m.epfl.ch/">4M official project page</a>, <em>Massively Multimodal Masked Modeling</em>, EPFL / Apple Research.</li> <li>Bachmann, R., et al.
